//! Each `DoIP` message contains a minimum length of 8 bytes of which is the
//! [`header`], within this the header contains the length of the [`message`]

/// # DoIP Message Builder Library
///
/// This module provides functionality to construct Diagnostic over IP (DoIP) messages used in automotive diagnostics
/// in accordance with ISO 13400 standards.
///
/// It includes a builder pattern implementation (`DoipMessageBuilder`) that allows users to configure and construct
/// valid `DoipMessage` instances with appropriate protocol headers and payloads. The builder ensures that metadata
/// such as payload type and length are automatically derived from the provided payload content.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - Typed and extensible `DoipPayload` variants for different message types
/// - Automatic header field population (e.g., inverse protocol version, payload length)
/// - Fluent, chainable builder interface
/// - Safe default values for rapid prototyping
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use your_crate_name::DoipMessageBuilder;
/// use your_crate_name::payloads::AliveCheckRequest;
/// use your_crate_name::DoipPayload;
///
/// let message = DoipMessageBuilder::new()
///     .protocol_version(ProtocolVersion::V1)
///     .payload(DoipPayload::AliveCheckRequest(AliveCheckRequest {}))
///     .build()
///     .expect("Failed to build DoIP message");
/// ```
///
/// ## Message Types Supported
///
/// - Alive Check (Request/Response)
/// - Vehicle Identification (Generic, EID, VIN)
/// - Vehicle Announcement
/// - Routing Activation (Request/Response)
/// - Entity Status (Request/Response)
/// - Power Information (Request/Response)
/// - Diagnostic Messages (Standard, ACK, NACK)
///
/// ## Intended Usage
///
/// This library is designed for integration into vehicle diagnostics applications,
/// simulation tools, or any system that needs to generate or send valid DoIP messages over a network.
///
/// ## Compliance
///
/// The design adheres to the structural requirements defined in ISO 13400 and aims to maintain
/// compatibility with UDS-on-IP diagnostic stacks and OEM-specific DoIP implementations.
